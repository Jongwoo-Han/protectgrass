    ├── node_modules
    ├── .eslintrc.js
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierignore
    ├── .prettierrc.js

1.  **`/.github/workflows`**: This directory contains settings about Github Actions.

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`.eslintrc.js`**: This is a configuration file for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

4.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

5.  **`.prettierignore`**: This file tells Prettier which files it should not format for.

6.  **`.prettierrc.js`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7.  **`LICENSE`**: protectgrass is licensed under the MIT license.

8.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

9.  **`history.log`**: This log file contains the commit timestamp.

10. **`index.js`**: This file modifies the `history.log` file when it runs.

11. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

12. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
