## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a protectgrass project.

    .
    ├── .github/workflows
    ├── node_modules
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── history.log
    ├── index.js
    ├── package-lock.json
    └── package.json

1.  **`/.github/workflows`**: This directory contains settings about Github Actions.

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`LICENSE`**: protectgrass is licensed under the MIT license.

5.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

6.  **`history.log`**: This log file contains the commit timestamp.

7.  **`index.js`**: This file modifies the `history.log` file when it runs.

8. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

9. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
